## Motivation
Tasked to create a landing page for a bootcamp of our invention. The focus being on the UI/UX design process. This included creating user personas and stories to really understand the users needs, and creating wireframes and high-fidelity designs in Figma to enable us to plan out the process. Majority of th work was done during th hackathon, I completed the rest in my own time.
## Lessons Learned

This project was mainly focused on the UX/UI side of a project. I did not have much experience of this prior to this hackathon so it was very new and interesting. 

Main lessons learned:

- Keep the user in mind at all stages of the design process.
- Figma is avery powerful and useful tool that I need to spend more time with.
- Taking time with the design process and using wireframes etc. makes planning out your code far more straightforward.
## Optimizations

Ensured all relevant images had alt text.
Ensured colours chosen for the landing page had sufficient contrast and would be accessible for people with colour-blindness etc.


## Improvements 

Potential future improvements:

- Add links to the different sections of the page.
- Fix the full width images and footer so they no longer have a small gap on either side.
- Add a contact form.
